# Portfolio

I'm Harish Chandramohan, working as Financial Model Developer at FreddieMac.

My Career goal is become a quant and then portfilio manager. I have Catherine Wood CEO as my role model for now.

I choose FinTech as a career path because I'm mesmerised by how finance and technology runs the world and I wish to be a part of it.
